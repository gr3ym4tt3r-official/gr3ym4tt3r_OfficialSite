## 🎨 Design System Overview

### Color Philosophy
Our color system reflects the GR3YM4TT3R brand identity through carefully chosen palettes that work across all themes and contexts.

### Typography Strategy
- **Primary:** Inter (Google Fonts) - Clean, modern, highly legible
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono - Code blocks and technical content
- **Scale:** Modular scale for consistent hierarchy

### Animation Principles
1. **Purpose-driven** - Every animation serves a functional purpose
2. **Performance-first** - Hardware-accelerated transforms
3. **Accessible** - Respects user preferences
4. **Branded** - Consistent with GR3YM4TT3R identity
